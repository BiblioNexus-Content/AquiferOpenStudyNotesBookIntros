    "content": "<p>Back in a Roman prison, Paul realized that he had reached the end of his race. His life, modeled on the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, was nearing its conclusion, so Paul commissioned his delegate Timothy to carry on his work. When Paul died at the hands of the Romans, this letter essentially became his epitaph (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:7-2Tim4:8\">4:7–8</a>), and through it, he empowered the church to carry on in his absence. The mission of the Good News would continue.</p><h1>Setting</h1><p>Following Paul’s conversion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19\">Acts 9:1–19</a>), his work as an apostle extended from Jerusalem in the east to as far west as Italy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:30-Acts28:31\">Acts 28:30–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:19\">Rom 15:19</a>), including considerable time in Asia Minor, and especially Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts20:1\">Acts 19:1–20:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:31\">20:31</a>). This period ended when Paul was arrested in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:27-Acts21:36\">Acts 21:27–36</a>), detained in Caesarea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:23-Acts26:32\">Acts 23:23–26:32</a>), and imprisoned in Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:16-Acts28:31\">Acts 28:16–31</a>). Paul was eventually released, and he engaged in further ministry. He wrote 1&nbsp;Timothy and Titus during this time. He was then arrested and imprisoned in Rome a second time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">1:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:16-2Tim1:17\">16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:9\">2:9</a>).</p><p>This letter, written from prison in Rome, came during the concluding episode of Paul’s life (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:6-2Tim4:18\">4:6–18</a>). It was written to Timothy, Paul’s faithful coworker and delegate. Timothy was in the province of Asia at that time, probably in Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:13\">4:13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:19\">19</a>). Paul was asking him to come to Rome as soon as possible. Suffering and persecution were likely for Timothy, too, if he came.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>After the traditional salutation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:1-2Tim1:2\">1:1–2</a>), thanksgiving, and prayer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:3-2Tim1:4\">1:3–4</a>), Paul charges Timothy to suffer with him for the Good News (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:5-2Tim1:18\">1:5–18</a>). The resources for doing so include Timothy’s spiritual heritage and the Good News itself, as illustrated by Paul’s life and by both good and bad examples.</p><p>Paul then charges Timothy again (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:1-2Tim2:13\">2:1–13</a>) to be strong and to endure suffering along with him. Again, Timothy’s obedience is to be motivated by reflection on the Good News and on Paul’s example. Paul then instructs Timothy on conducting his ministry among the false teachers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:14-2Tim2:26\">2:14–26</a>).</p><p>The perspective then broadens to set Timothy’s task in the context of the last days (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:1-2Tim4:8\">3:1–4:8</a>). These days will be difficult, but God will deal with troublemakers just as he has in the past. Timothy is to stay on track with the faith he has inherited and remain rooted in the Scriptures. He is to carry out his ministry with a sense of urgency in light of his hope and the increasing resistance of his listeners. He is not to be afraid of suffering for the Lord, and he is to consider Paul’s work as completed. Timothy must step into the gap and continue to follow the example of Paul.</p><p>The letter closes with an appeal for Timothy to come to Rome as soon as possible (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:9-2Tim4:18\">4:9–18</a>). Paul gives greetings, news, and a final urging for Timothy to make his journey to Rome before winter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:19-2Tim4:21\">4:19–21</a>). Then Paul closes with a blessing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:22\">4:22</a>).</p><h1>Date of Writing</h1><p>It is possible that 2&nbsp;Timothy was written during Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:1-Acts28:31\">Acts 28:1–31</a>). The evidence, however, gives stronger support to a later date, during a second imprisonment in Rome that resulted in Paul’s death (see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"ITim_BookIntro_Filament-1.6\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">1&nbsp;Timothy Book Introduction</span>, “Date of Writing”).</p><h1>Occasion of Writing</h1><p>We do not know the details of Paul’s second arrest. Perhaps Alexander (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:14-2Tim4:15\">4:14–15</a>), a heretic whom Paul had disciplined earlier (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:20\">1&nbsp;Tim 1:20</a>), had a hand in the arrest (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:16-2Tim4:18\">2 Tim 4:16–18</a>). It might have occurred in Asia Minor (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:15\">1:15</a>); if so, Paul’s heretical opponents—the false teachers discussed in 1&nbsp;Timothy and Titus—were not just making idle threats. The struggle in which Paul and Timothy were engaged (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:3\">2 Tim 2:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:7\">4:7</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:18\">1&nbsp;Tim 1:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim6:12\">6:12</a>) was not simply metaphorical or spiritual. The directions on prayer for civil authorities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim2:1-1Tim2:7\">1&nbsp;Tim 2:1–7</a>; cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus3:1\">Titus 3:1</a>) may be understood as relating to wider problems created for the churches by false teachers, problems that resulted in Paul’s final arrest and execution for the Good News. The false teachers were still on the prowl (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:14-2Tim3:9\">2 Tim 2:14–3:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:14-2Tim4:15\">4:14–15</a>). Paul viewed his ministry as being completed and knew that his death was imminent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:6-2Tim4:8\">4:6–8</a>), so he was encouraging Timothy to carry on the work. It is possible that a visit to Paul in Rome would have included some sort of formal commissioning of Timothy.</p><h1>Meaning and Message</h1><p>The apostle Paul had not only proclaimed the Good News of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; he had personally enacted it. The Good News gives rise to a way of life that takes up the cross and follows Jesus in the life-giving power of his resurrection. Paul had modeled his life after Christ’s, and now his death was at hand. God’s work will be completed right up to the day of Christ’s return (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:12\">1:12</a>), and the continuing responsibility of God’s servants is great. Paul passed the torch to Timothy and challenged him to carry his work forward.</p><p>As with Timothy, all who take up the cross and follow Jesus are charged to complete the ministry that God has given them, through the life-giving power of Christ’s resurrection.</p>",
